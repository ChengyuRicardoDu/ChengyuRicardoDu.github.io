## Profile

I am a doctoral student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I am advised by Dr. Zhengqing Ouyang and work with the [Ouyang Lab](https://people.umass.edu/ouyanglab/). I am also an M.S. student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. Previously, during my M.S. training in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I worked closely with Prof. [Ruoqing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/teazrq/) on statistical learning problems in high-dimensional biology, including spatial transcriptomics and dimension reduction. I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University.

My research focuses on statistical and computational methods for high-dimensional biological data, especially spatial transcriptomics and 3D genomics, with particular interest in kernel methods and manifold learning for complex biological systems.
