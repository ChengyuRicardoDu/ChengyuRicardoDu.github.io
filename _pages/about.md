I am a doctoral student in Biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (advisor: Dr. Zhengqing Ouyang), and also an M.S. student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University.

My research focuses on statistical and computational methods for high-dimensional biological data, especially spatial transcriptomics and 3D genomics. I am particularly interested in kernel methods and manifold learning for understanding complex biological systems.
